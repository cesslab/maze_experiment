        <p>
            Consider the following option. You are given 1 minute to solve a maze. 50% of
            students that tried to solve this maze in 1 minute succeeded. If you solve the
            maze, you win $8. If you don’t, you win $4. We shall call this the “Maze” option.
            For each of the cases below, you must choose between the “Maze” option and a
            lottery. For instance, in Case 2, you have to choose between the “Maze” option
            and the lottery that pays $8 with probability 80% and $4 with probability 20%.</p>
        <p>
            Your payoff in this task will be determined as follows. We randomly select
            one of the eleven cases. If, in the selected case, you chose the Maze, you will
            be given 1 minute to solve a Maze and if you solve it you win $8. Otherwise,
            you win $4. If you chose the lottery, then you get to play the lottery associated
            with the selected case.
