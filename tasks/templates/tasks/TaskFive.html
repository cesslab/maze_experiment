        <p>
            You are endowed with 100 tokens and asked to choose the portion of this amount (between 0 and 100 tokens, inclusive) that you wish to invest in a risky option. Those tokens not invested are yours to keep.
        </p>
        <p>
            If the investment is successful, you receive 2.5 times the amount you chose to invest; if the investment is unsuccessful, you lose the amount invested.
        </p>
        <p>
            To determine if the investment is successful or not, we roll a four-faced die, with faces A, B, C, D.
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>If we get face A or D the investment is successful.</li>
            <li>If we get faces B or C the investment is unsuccessful.</li>
        </ul>
    <p>
        We now ask you to indicate the number of tokens that you wish to invest by entering it to the box below (1 token is converted to 1 cent).
