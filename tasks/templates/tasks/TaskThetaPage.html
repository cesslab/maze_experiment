            You are endowed with 100 tokens and asked to choose the portion of this amount (between 0 and 100 tokens, inclusive) that you wish to invest in a risky option. Those tokens not invested are yours to keep.
        </p>
        <p>
            If the investment is successful, you receive 2.5 times the amount you chose to invest; if the investment is unsuccessful, you lose the amount invested.
        </p>
        <p>
            To determine if the investment is successful or not, we first of all roll a four-faced die, with faces A, B, C, D.
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>If we get face A the investment is successful.</li>
            <li>If we get face D the investment is unsuccessful.</li>
            <li>If we get face B or C, then we roll the die again.
            <ul>
                <li>If we get face A or B, the investment is successful.</li>
                <li>Otherwise, if we get face C or D, the investment is unsuccessful.</li>
            </ul>
            </li>
        </ul>
    <p>
        We now ask you to indicate the number of tokens that you wish to invest by entering it to the box below (1 token is converted to 1 cent).
    </p>
    <p>
        If this task is chosen for payment you will receive one cent per token kept and 2.5 cents for each token invested if the investment is successful and zero if the investment is unsuccessful.
