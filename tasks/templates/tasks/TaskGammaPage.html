  <p>Consider six dollar amounts, $ 0, $2, $4, $8, $10 and $12. In the tasks below we are going to give you a
choice between getting a certain amount of money for sure, either $2, $4, $8 or $10 and a gamble that
gives you either $12 or $0 with probabilities to be determined by you. Your task is to tell us what
probability you would demand in order to make you indifferent between one of those amounts for sure
      and a gamble giving you either $12 or $0 with the probability you specified.</p>

<p>For example, consider the following four hypothetical amounts money: $0, $1200, $3000, $9000. In the
tasks below we will ask you questions like: What probability would you need to make you indifferent
between receiving $3000 for sure and a gamble that gives you a chance p% of getting $9000 and a
chance (100-p)% of getting $0. For example, if you state 90% then you would be saying that you would be
indifferent between $3000 for sure and a gamble giving you a 10% change of getting $0 and a 90%
chance of getting $9000. When we say that you are indifferent we mean that you state a probability
which is such that if we flipped a fair coin that would land heads or tails with a 50% chance and gave you
the sure amount if it landed heads and the lottery if it landed tails, you would not care which side of the
    coin it landed on.</p>

<p>To insure that you report your true indifference probability we will do the following. You will enter the
probability that will make you indifferent into the computer. We will then choose a probability randomly
between 0% and 100%. If the probability we pick is less than the one you stated as making you indifferent,
then you will not engage in the lottery but rather get the sure amount paid to you. If, however, the
random probability is greater than the one you stated, then we will play out the lottery but with the
random probability rather than the one you stated. More precisely, say you state that a probability of
40% would make you indifferent between a sure prize and a lottery of a big one and a small one. If the
random probability we choose is smaller than 40%, then you get the sure payment. If, however say the
random probability is say 60%, we will have you play out the lottery but with a probability of 60% of you
getting the big prize which is higher than you stated. Note that if you state a probability of 100% you will
always get the sure prize while if you state a probability of 0% you will always get the lottery but possibly
    with a very low chance of getting the big prize.</p>
